# Average_salary_by_job_classification

This dataset provided the insight into salary distributions across various job roles. My analysis & visualizations highlight the top 10 positions, top 5 positions with the highest number of employees and the salary trends with the hightest grade numbers.

💻 Skills Used
SQL (joins, aggregation, filtering, via phpMyAdmin)
Relational data modeling
Data cleaning & preparation
Data visualization (line, pie and bar charts)
Github & Tableau public for project organization 

📊 Data Sources
[Kaggle dataset: Average Salary by Job Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sonawanelalitsunil/average-salary-by-job-classification)
